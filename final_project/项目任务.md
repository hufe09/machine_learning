```
# Task 1: Select what features you'll use.
# features_list is a list of strings, each of which is a feature name.
# The first feature must be "poi".
```

```
# Task 2: Remove outliers
# Task 3: Create new feature(s)
# Store to my_dataset for easy export below.
```

```
# Task 4: Try a varity of classifiers
# Please name your classifier clf for easy export below.
# Note that if you want to do PCA or other multi-stage operations,
# you'll need to use Pipelines. For more info:
# http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/pipeline.html
```

```
# Task 5: Tune your classifier to achieve better than .3 precision and recall
# using our testing script. Check the tester.py script in the final project
# folder for details on the evaluation method, especially the test_classifier
# function. Because of the small size of the dataset, the script uses
# stratified shuffle split cross validation. For more info:
# http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cross_validation.StratifiedShuffleSplit.html
```

```
# Task 6: Dump your classifier, dataset, and features_list so anyone can
# check your results. You do not need to change anything below, but make sure
# that the version of poi_id.py that you submit can be run on its own and
# generates the necessary .pkl files for validating your results.
